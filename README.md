# hello-world

This is my first prject using GitHub

My name is Makayla Baldwin. I am attending college at Cleveland Community College and majoring in an associates degree in Web Administration and Design. I find web design to be extremely fun and it would be a dream to get a job out of it. In April 2018 I am marrying my fiance Jaden who I have been with since middle school (4 years.) I am so excited for my life to begin!
